Daily Expense Tracker - Project Report
1. Introduction
1.1 Project Aim
The primary objective of this project was to develop a simple, robust, and user-friendly command-line
application in Python capable of tracking daily personal or small-scale business expenses. The
program needed to meet two core functional requirements: the ability to record detailed expenses and
the ability to generate meaningful summary reports.
1.2 Problem Statement
Many commercial budget trackers are overly complex or rely on internet connectivity. The need
identified was for a lightweight, local solution that prioritizes quick data entry and persistent storage
without external dependencies. This project addresses the challenge of managing personal finance
data efficiently using only standard Python capabilities.
2. Methodology and Implementation
2.1 Core Data Structure and Persistence
The decision was made to use the Comma Separated Values (CSV) format for data persistence. This
approach offers several benefits:
1. Human-Readable: The data can be viewed and edited easily outside the program.
2. Standard Module: Python's built-in csv module provides robust methods for reading and
writing data, eliminating the need for external libraries or complex database management.
The data schema for the expenses.csv file is fixed with the following headers: Date , Amount ,
Category , and Description .
2.2 Python Modules Used
Module Function
csv Used for reading data from and writing data to the expenses.csv file.
os Used primarily in the initialize_csv function to check for the existence of the data file.
datetime Used to automatically timestamp each expense record for accurate tracking.
2.3 Key Functions
add_expense()
This function handles user input and data validation:
1. It uses a while loop and a try-except block to ensure the Amount input is a valid positive
floating-point number.

2. It lists predefined categories and validates the user's numeric selection.
3. It automatically records the current timestamp using datetime.now().strftime() .
4. The data is appended to the expenses.csv file in append mode ( 'a' ).
view_summary()
This is the analysis function:
1. It initializes a dictionary ( expenses_by_category ) to hold the accumulated totals for each
category.
2. It iterates through every row of the CSV file, skipping the header.
3. It performs runtime data conversion ( float() ) and handles potential ValueError or
IndexError gracefully, ensuring a corrupted row does not crash the entire report.
4. Finally, it calculates and prints the percentage contribution of each category to the total
spending, offering a quick visual assessment of expenditure focus.
3. Results and Conclusion
3.1 Results
The Daily Expense Tracker successfully fulfills the project requirements. It provides a reliable
mechanism for data entry and generates an accurate, easily digestible financial summary. The use of a
CSV file for storage ensures data integrity and accessibility.
3.2 Future Scope
Potential enhancements for this project include:
1. Date Filtering: Implement an option to view summaries for specific periods (e.g., "last 7 days" or
"current month").
2. Graphical Interface (GUI): Migrate the current command-line interface to a simple GUI using
libraries like Tkinter or PyQt for improved user experience.
3. Data Visualization: Incorporate libraries like matplotlib to generate basic bar charts or pie
charts of the spending breakdown.
4. Security: Implement basic password protection or encryption for the expenses.csv file if the
tracker is to be used in a shared environment.

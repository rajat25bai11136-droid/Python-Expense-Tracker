💰 Daily Expense Tracker (Python)

Project Description

This is a simple, command-line utility built in Python designed to help users quickly log and summarize daily financial expenditures. It stores all data persistently in a local CSV file (expenses.csv), allowing for easy tracking and analysis of spending habits across different categories.

Features

Add Expense: Log a new expenditure with a date, amount, category, and description.

Category Selection: Uses a predefined list of common categories (Food, Transport, Utilities, Entertainment, Other).

Summary Report: Generates a detailed breakdown of total spending by category, including percentages, and a grand total.

Data Persistence: All records are saved to expenses.csv and loaded every time the program runs.
